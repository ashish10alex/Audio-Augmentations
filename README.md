# box-play
A simple website to display audio and its spectrogram when an augmentation/operation is applied to the audio.  

To run the web app -

```
python3 app.py
```
and go to your web browser (e.g chrome/safari): <dl> <link> localhost:5000 </link> </dl>

To do 

* Better file uploader 
* Check if uploaded file is audio and do error handling
* Load examples dynamically with Jinja for loop
* Remove border from client audio plots
* Use threads to load multiple augmented files
